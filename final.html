# 同性戀態度

.pull-left[
### 負面 / 恐同可能因素
- 年齡較大 .small[(Herk, 1984)]
- 男性 &gt; 女性
- 較少接觸到高等教育
- 鄉下或小城鎮
- 結過婚的 .small[(Seltzer, 1992)]
- 收入較低者 .small[(West &amp; Cowell, 2013)]
- 家中成員多 .small[(Adamczyk &amp; Pitt, 2009)]

__交互作用項__

- 大學教育以上的中年人比起老年人與年輕人較有正面態度 .small[(Seltzer, 1992)]
- 青少年與大學年齡的男性比中年人更可能持強烈的否定立場 .small[王晴峰, 2013]
]

.pull-right[
### 並非所有研究都相同
- 年齡大者反而負面態度較小 .small[(West &amp; Cowell,2013)]
- 性別差異不顯著 .small[(Bowman, 1979; Glenn &amp; Weaver,1979)]
- 與收入高地無關 .small[(Gelbal &amp; Duyan 2006; Becker &amp; Scheufele, 2009)]

# 同性戀態度

Jäckle &amp; Wenzelburger (2015)  
- 對79國的同性戀態度進行多元迴歸分析，其中包含:宗較、年紀、家中小孩人數、有無結婚、收入、教育狀態...等都有顯著影響。其中特別是.red[宗教信仰]最能影響同性戀態度的取向

Adamczyk &amp; Liao (2019)  
- 透過後設分析，將主要影響各國同性戀態度的原因歸類至.red[經濟、民主、宗教]三個主要因子

--

總結來說，可能的影響因子：  
- __年齡、性別、區域(都市/鄉下)、婚姻狀況、教育程度、經濟收入、種族、民主、宗教__...等
- 以及變項間的交互作用
- 雖然有許多變項會影響同性戀態度，但受限於資料的取得 (如：台灣並無宗教信仰普查)，故期望後續研究得以加入。

1. 抓取資料及資料清洗
2. 建立 first-order model
3. 整斷與修補模型 (變異數同質和常態分佈假設)

5. 重複步驟 3
6. 檢查共線性、離群值、影響力指標並作修整
7. Bootstrap
8. 選出最終模型

過往文獻中年齡對於同性戀的態度也尚未有定論，且會與其他因素交雜在一起


一開始我們都以為，年紀較長者不容易接受婚姻平權，因此比較容易投不同意票


然而依據做中模型的結果，年齡中位數越高的地區反而同意率較高

--

若我們將依照年齡拆成三組與同意率做散佈圖

- 年輕人 (18~30) 負相關
- 中年人 (31-65) 正相關
- 老年人 (65-)   無相關

# 研究限制

.large[
- 公投14案：同性婚姻納入民法 `\(\neq\)` 同性戀態度  


- 鄉鎮市區為每筆資料單位，但真的有代表性嗎  


- 無法得之確切的投票人行為和態度  


- 缺少一些可能的潛在變項 (宗教、家庭人數等)  


- 離島 (界外值) 特別性質

# 未來可改進方向

.large[
- 納入宗教信仰資料或是其它文獻回顧中提及的重要變項 (如果有的話啊啦！)  


- 本研究資料不一定要用多元迴歸分析，由於我們的反應變項 (同意率) 範圍從 0-1，或許 logistic regression 會是個不錯的選擇
